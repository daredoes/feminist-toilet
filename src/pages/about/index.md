title: Toilets are the ultimate feminists.
---
Tell me one person you know
that doesn't shit. Exactly. Everyone has experiences with toilets. 
They are liminal spaces where society meets humanity - where
we let our animal side out. I mean it's a bit weird what happens 
in those sanitary sanctuaries, and yet never talk about it. It's
fucking earthly in there. I think what happens in toilets is beautiful. 
It is the place one can be most vulnerable. It is a safe space, 
a private place in a public world. 
Please enjoy these pieces inspired by the toilet, our beloved porcelain deity.
