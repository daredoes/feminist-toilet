i asked her to cut off my finger

standing at the entry way or was it exit

watching her ride down the east london road perched atop a metallic bike rack

foreheads touching i mumbled

we entwined on the couch, Rod of Asclepius

harmless snake or more cliche;

serpent imploring to taste the fruit of knowledge

was the snake satisfied having catalyzed the fall

was eve made better

gaze demanding she cut his finger

save him from playlists encumbered by love songs

mind consumed by alternative hypotheses

naive expectations of a future apart

her vacant stare past fabric stores

creaky bike chirping flanked by chicken shops

she cant or she wont

she did that stupid thing

ive seen it in the movies

while i helped her with her spreadsheet

of all things

she resting her body against mine

as a lover

leg delicately weighing non-attached

is it her nakedness that consumes me?

my romanticized crywank.

my friend, ascribed meaning where there was none.

im sad to know (youre leaving). and leaving me with the lovecraftian horrors.

and our adventures on bikes threatening to fall apart.

rattling down dirt paths and cobblestones.

already i commemorate these in marble monoliths to future gods.

we pause to think on time at south bank gallery.

surrounded by wellcome and neon paint.

love or in love; chaos limerence; chaos vagina

crowds out my decision to love.

reveals youth.

which is why i cannot love.

only be in love
