Don’t expect me to say that word. 

I’ll tip toe around, dodging those contaminated places 

I’ll replace “toilet” with “bathroom” 

Feign retching if you bring up behaviours in “that department”. 



But why? 

Well, there’s nothing pristine in poo 

I felt the word “love” couldn’t be uttered by one that says “loo”... 



Haha. 

Misguided – I see now 

The shit’ll hit the fan unless you embrace it.
