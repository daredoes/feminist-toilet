I need to get off this bus and find a toilet. 

Cow tongue for dinner probably wasn’t the best choice last night. 

So much for being adventurous. 

Yup, I’m getting off. 

It’s pouring rain and I don’t think there’s a public restroom in the area. 

There wasn’t one in the grocery store last time I checked. 

Living in South America has been a good experience, but if they give me a comment card on the way out, I’m going to recommend more toilets. And apologize to anybody who was forced to witness a white dude shitting in an alley somewhere near the corner of 12 de Octubre and Mariscal Foch.  

Is there an alley here? 

I don’t have much time. 

Wait, that brewery I haven’t been to yet might have a bathroom. 

In from the rain, I ask the hostess.  

Yes, in that direction. 

The toilet marked for the male variety of humans is occupied. Or, at least, it’s locked. I don’t wait around to see if there’s an actual soul behind the door. 

I’ll use the women’s if necessary. If it’s open, no scrutiny will descend until I emerge. 

Thank god.  

There’s a third. A family toilet? Or for wheelchair users? 

Doesn’t matter. 

Right now it’s for me. 

Relief. Thank you jesus. My panic dances away on the throne of mercy. 

I used to be a fervent believer. This would have been another example of grace. 

Now, I’ll leave it up to good fortune.   

I’m sure a poor soul is shitting in the alley somewhere else in the world. 

For now, this brewery is my savior. 

I should repay it and become a patron.    

But when I leave the restroom, I see a clear path to the door. 

I hope that grace is real and stride through the entry, back into the rain.
