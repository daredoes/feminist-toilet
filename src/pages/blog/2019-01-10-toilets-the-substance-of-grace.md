I need to get off this bus and find a toilet. 



Cow tongue for dinner probably wasn’t the best choice last night. 



So much for being adventurous. 



Yup, I’m getting off. 



It’s pouring rain and I don’t think there’s a public restroom in the area. 



There wasn’t one in the grocery store last time I checked. 



Living in South America has been a good experience, but if they give me a comment card on the way out, I’m going to recommend more toilets. And apologize to anybody who was forced to witness a white dude shitting in an alley somewhere near the corner of 12 de Octubre and Mariscal Foch.  



Is there an alley here? 



I don’t have much time. 



Wait, that brewery I haven’t been to yet might have a bathroom. 



In from the rain, I ask the hostess.  



Yes, in that direction. 



The toilet marked for the male variety of humans is occupied. Or, at least, it’s locked. I don’t wait around to see if there’s an actual soul behind the door. 



I’ll use the women’s if necessary. If it’s open, no scrutiny will descend until I emerge. 



Thank god.  



There’s a third. A family toilet? Or for wheelchair users? 



Doesn’t matter. 



Right now it’s for me. 



Relief. Thank you jesus. My panic dances away on the throne of mercy. 



I used to be a fervent believer. This would have been another example of grace. 



Now, I’ll leave it up to good fortune.   



I’m sure a poor soul is shitting in the alley somewhere else in the world. 



For now, this brewery is my savior. 



I should repay it and become a patron.    



But when I leave the restroom, I see a clear path to the door. 



I hope that grace is real and stride through the entry, back into the rain.
