At night a girl haunts my toilet. 

I see the shadow of her

in the hallway, hear

the bathroom door open,

bare feet on cold tiles. 

I have never seen her face

but in the mornings I 

find clumps of her hair, 

long black strands floating 

in the water like tentacles.

She formulates into a shape, 

stepping cyclically around my head, 

seeping out of my mouth

until she becomes someone I accommodate, 

a guest in my house. 

I begin to leave halved figs in the sink, 

place blankets and pillows 

in the bath before bed. 

I make sure there is enough toilet roll.

I use the downstairs toilet so as not to disturb her.

I wake to find the figs eaten, 

the blankets heavy with shower gel,

footprints outlined in urine. 

I wonder if she has ever learned to use a toilet. 

She stays for two months, 

small disturbances seeping to the rest of the house. 

Her hair hangs from door knobs

and windows. 

She begins to leave a trail of fig pulp, 

spots of yellow urine on the floor. 

Flies cluster round. 

I keep bleach in by bedroom, 

stumbling around, half asleep, 

to clean up after her. 

But one day she is gone. 

The traces of her disappear, 

the flies leave with her. 

I stop putting figs in the sink.

I start to use the upstairs toilet again.
