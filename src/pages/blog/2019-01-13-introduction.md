Toilets are the ultimate feminists. Tell me one person you know that doesn't shit. Exactly. Everyone has experiences with toilets. They are liminal spaces where society meets humanity - where we let our animal side out. I mean it's a bit weird what happens in those sanitary sanctuaries, and yet never talk about it. It's fucking earthly in there. I think what happens in toilets is beautiful. It is the place one can be most vulnerable. It is a safe space, a private place in a public world. 

Please enjoy these poems, prose pieces, essays, images, and artwork inspired by the toilet, our beloved porcelain deity.
